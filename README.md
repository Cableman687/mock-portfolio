# Module-2-Challenge

## Description
- The motivivation to complete this test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to: media query screens, flexboxes, responsive design & pseudo-classes.
- This project was build as a testing ground for these programming skills
- It solves the problem of whether or not the knowledge gained in the last week was sufficient in order to build this application, and the extent to which I was able to complete it without external support.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week that can be used to build an effective website.
