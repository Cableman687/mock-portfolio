# Module-1-Challenge

## Description
- This project was completed as a challenge for the completion of Module 1 as part of the UWA coding bootcamp.
- The motivation to build this was to gain the ability to assess existing repositories, audit them, and push changes and improvements to the code as part of the agile development framework.
- By doing this, it will mean that any future code written either by myself or others will be done so using the agile development frame work and will meet the acceptance criteria for accessability standards.
- By completing this challenge I learnt the correct way to write and assess HTML and CSS code as-per industry standards.

## Usage
This repository will act as a location for the completed Module #1 Challenge, with all supporting HTML, CSS and README files.
The use will be for the assessment of this challenge by the tutors, as well as a reference point for any future learning.
